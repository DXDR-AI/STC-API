# Screenshot2Code (S2C)

In a nutshell: Screenshot code that is written in just about any language, and use Screenshot2Code to convert it to textual format!  
> Note: this project is currently in ideation stage.

## The Basics: Copy-Paste
Copy-pasting code is done all the time for a plethora of purposes!
1. **Code Generation**: Whether it's CoPilot, ChatGPT, or any other code generation platform, it's now very often the case that you'll need to copy and paste code from these generators into your IDE.
2. **Code from Websites** such as StackOverflow can be copied and pasted into your IDE, or vice versa.
3. **Collaborating**: When collaborating on a project with other developers, it may be necessary to copy and paste code snippets or entire functions to share them with other team members. This can be a quick and easy way to share code and collaborate effectively. But sending code through textual messages on social media runs into so many problems, so people often send screenshots instead.
4. **Reusing code**: Copy and paste code from an existing project or codebase to reuse it in a new project. This can save time and effort and also ensure consistency across projects.
5. **Learning and experimenting**: When learning a new programming language or technology, a developer might copy and paste code snippets from tutorials or forums to experiment with and understand how things work. This can help the developer learn faster and make progress more efficiently.

Whatever the case, there are several common problems you may run into.

## The Problem with Copy-Paste
1. **Formatting issues**: When copying and pasting code between different text editors or programs, the formatting of the code can sometimes get messed up. This can include issues with line breaks, indentation, and spacing, which can make the code difficult to read and understand.
2. **Encoding issues**: Different text editors and programs often use different character encodings, which can cause problems when copying and pasting code between them. This can result in issues with special characters or non-ASCII characters, which can be problematic in internationalization and localization contexts.
3. **Clipboard size limitations**: Some operating systems may have limitations on the size of the clipboard, which can prevent large blocks of code from being copied and pasted.
4. **Clipboard interference**: Other applications can interfere with the clipboard, causing copied text to be lost or overwritten.

**Screenshots, on the other hand, preserve all the information, regardless of origin.**

## Screenshot2Code vs. Existing Methods
Why is Screenshot2Code needed?
- Existing frameworks, libraries, and APIs
  - 
- Generative AI - why not just ask AGI to do it?
  - **GPT-4** can handle image modalities, but it is not accessible to everyone and it is not specialized for this purpose
  - **ChatGPT** does not accept image input.
  - **Google Bard** as of its initial release cannot handle image modalities.
  - **Github CoPilot** cannot handle image modalities.
  - **Codex** cannot handle image modalities.

What about current open-source APIs?
- There aren't any tha






## Technical
Screenshots almost always come in one of two formats depending on the OS.
- **macOS**, **Ubuntu**, and other Linux-based OS's: .png
- **Windows**: .jpg, .jpeg
