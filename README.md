# Screenshot2Code (S2C)

In a nutshell: Screenshot code that is written in just about any language, and use Screenshot2Code to convert it to textual format!  
&rarr; Note: this project is currently in ideation stage.

## Scenario
- Copy-paste for code can cause many problems, especially when transferring code across platforms. Conventional copy-paste often loses information such as indentation and spacing and adds extraneous information depending on IDE, OS, and other factors. 
- Screenshots, on the other hand, preserve information!

Copy-pasting code is done all the time for a plethora of purposes!
1. **Code Generation**: Whether it's Github Copilot, ChatGPT, 
**Reusing code**: Copy and paste code from an existing project or codebase to reuse it in a new project. This can save time and effort and also ensure consistency across projects.
2. **Learning and experimenting**: When learning a new programming language or technology, a developer might copy and paste code snippets from tutorials or forums to experiment with and understand how things work. This can help the developer learn faster and make progress more efficiently.
3. 
4. Collaborating: When collaborating on a project with other developers, it may be necessary to copy and paste code snippets or entire functions to share them with other team members. This can be a quick and easy way to share code and collaborate effectively.

## Technical
Screenshots almost always come in one of two formats depending on the OS.
- **macOS**, **Ubuntu**, and other Linux-based OS's: .png
- **Windows**: .jpg, .jpeg





Why is Screenshot2Code needed over existing methods?
- Existing frameworks, libraries, and APIs
  - 
- Generative AI - why not just ask AGI to do it?
  - **GPT-4** can handle image modalities, but it is not accessible to everyone and it is not specialized for this purpose
  - **ChatGPT** does not accept image input.
  - **Google Bard** as of its initial release cannot handle image modalities.
  - **Github CoPilot** cannot handle image modalities.
  - **Codex** cannot handle image modalities.

What about current open-source APIs?
- There aren't any tha
